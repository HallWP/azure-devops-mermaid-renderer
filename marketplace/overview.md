# Mermaid Renderer

Render and preview [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) diagrams in the repo.

This extension currently only works with `.mmd` files.

Mermaid diagrams embedded within markdown file rendering is not handled. Integration with markdown will be added in a future release.

## Usage

Install this extension to your Azure DevOps Organization.

Choose any Mermaid Diagram (`.mmd`) file in your repo. The preview pane will show the rendered content of Mermaid Diagram.

Select a `.mmd` containing a mermaid diagram:

![Raw Mermaid Diagram](marketplace/mermaid-diagram-raw.png)

Click on the `Preview` tab to see the rendered diagram:

![Preview Mermaid Diagram](marketplace/mermaid-diagram-preview.png)

The extension leverages the latest Mermaid version available from CDN, so new features should be available as soon as they are released.

## Feedback

Please let us know how the extension can be improved! Contributions are also welcome!
